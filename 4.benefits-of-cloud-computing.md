# Benefit of cloud computing

## Agility

The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly
anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them–from infrastructure services, 
such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.



## Cost saving

The cloud allows you to trade fixed expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, 
and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do
it yourself because of the economies of scale. 



## Elasticity

With cloud computing, you don’t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity 
in the future. Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources 
up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.





## Deploy global in minutes

With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example,
AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical 
locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency 
and improves their experience.
