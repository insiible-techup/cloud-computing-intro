# Types of cloud computing deployment models

## Public cloud

Public clouds are run by third-party cloud service providers.
They offer compute, storage, and network resources over the internet,
enabling companies to access shared on-demand resources based on their unique requirements and business goals.

## Private cloud

Private clouds are built, managed, and owned by a single organization and privately hosted in their own data centers,
commonly known as “on-premises” or “on-prem.” They provide greater control, security, and management of data while
still enabling internal users to benefit from a shared pool of compute, storage, and network resources.

## Hybrid cloud

Hybrid clouds combine public and private cloud models, allowing companies to leverage public cloud services
and maintain the security and compliance capabilities commonly found in private cloud architectures.
