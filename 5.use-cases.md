# Uses of cloud computing

You’re probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don’t realize it. If you use an online service to send email,
edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games, or store pictures and other files, it’s likely that cloud
computing is making it all possible behind the scenes.

## Here are a few examples of what’s possible with cloud services from a cloud provider

## Create cloud-native applications

Quickly build, deploy, and scale applications—web, mobile, and API. Take advantage of cloud-native technologies and approaches,
such as containers, Kubernetes, microservices architecture, API-driven communication, and DevOps.

## Store, back up, and recover data

Protect your data more cost-efficiently—and at massive scale—by transferring your data over the internet to
an offsite cloud storage system that’s accessible from any location and any device.

## Stream audio and video

Connect with your audience anywhere, anytime, on any device with high-definition video and audio with global distribution.

## Deliver software on demand

Also known as software as a service (SaaS), on-demand software lets you offer the latest software versions
and updates to customers—anytime they need, anywhere they are.

## Test and build applications

Reduce application development cost and time by using cloud infrastructures that can easily be scaled up or down.

## Analyze data

Unify your data across teams, divisions, and locations in the cloud. Then use cloud services, such as machine
learning and artificial intelligence, to uncover insights for more informed decisions.

## Embed intelligence

Use intelligent models to help engage customers and provide valuable insights from the data captured.
