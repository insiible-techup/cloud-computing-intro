# What is cloud computing


Cloud computing refers to the ability to access IT resources anywhere you are!

`Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources (compute, storage, Networking, database and many more) over the internet at a pay-as-you-go pricing policy`

## NOTE

cloud service provider is simply someone who sell cloud services
examples( aws, gcp azure,)

## Components of cloud computing

1; Data centers

CSPs own and operate remote data centers that house physical or bare metal servers,
cloud storage systems and other physical hardware that create the underlying
infrastructure and provide the physical foundation for cloud computing.

Also known as zones
When you have multiple of these zones we call them regions

2; Networking capabilities
In cloud computing, high-speed networking connections are crucial.

3; Virtualization

Cloud computing relies heavily on the virtualization of IT infrastructure—servers,
operating system software, networking and other infrastructure that’s abstracted
using special software so that it can be pooled and divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries
For example, a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers.
